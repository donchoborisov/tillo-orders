## Explanation

I have copied the orders.json to my storage folder and then I create a separate controller (Orders Controller) to complete the actions point from the test. 
I have point the controller and the method to the home route. 

The method in the controller doing the action and sending the data to the front-end is orders() 

1. I'm getting the data from the JSON file
2. with json_decode im converting the data from json object to a php object we have 2 parameters the first one is the variable with the json object and second parameter is TRUE which means JSON objects will be returned as associative arrays.
3.I'm wrapping the data into a collection each and every time which is giving me option to apply lots of methods to manipulate with the data inside.
